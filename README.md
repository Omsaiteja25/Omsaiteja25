Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Data Analyst with a passion for transforming data into meaningful insights. A recent graduate from IIT BHU, I have developed strong analytical skills through both academic and practical experiences. My technical expertise spans across SQL, Power BI, and Excel, which Iâ€™ve utilized in multiple projects to build dynamic dashboards, analyze large datasets, and provide actionable recommendations.

I recently completed a Data Analytics certification from Skillovilla, where I gained expertise in data manipulation, visualization, and reporting. I enjoy working on projects that involve complex data problems and delivering insights through dynamic dashboards.

Beyond data analytics, Iâ€™m an avid reader and I enjoy playing cricket. Iâ€™m always keen on learning new technologies, staying up-to-date with industry trends, and taking on new challenges that push me to grow as a professional.

Feel free to explore my repositories, check out my projects, and connect with me if you want to collaborate on solving real-world problems using data. ðŸ˜Š

Skills: SQL, Power BI, Excel, Data Modeling, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization.
